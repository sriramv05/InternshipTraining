    <h1>Technology Stack</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>1. Front-End (Mobile App Development)</h3>
        <p><b>Framework:</b> Use a cross-platform framework so the app works on both Android and iOS.<br>

        <u><b>Option 1:</b> Flutter (Dart)</u> - A Google-backed framework that provides fast development and beautiful UI.<br>
        <u><b>Option 2:</b> React Native (JavaScript)</u> - A Facebook-backed framework that allows building mobile apps with JavaScript and React.<br>
        <b>Features to build:</b><br>

        <u>SOS Button:</u> Trigger alerts.<br>
        <u>Maps & Navigation:</u> Display routes for ambulance drivers using Google Maps API.<br>
        <u>Push Notifications:</u> Implement using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time notifications.</p>
        <h3>2. Backend Development</h3>
        <p><b>Backend Framework:</b> Use a server to handle requests and send real-time updates.<br>

        <u><b>Option 1:</b> Node.js with Express</u> - Fast, non-blocking, and ideal for real-time applications.<br>
        <u><b>Option 2:</b> Django (Python)</u> - A high-level framework that's easy to use and secure.<br>
        <b>Real-Time Communication:</b><br>

        <u>WebSockets or Firebase Real-time Database</u> - To push live updates like when an ambulance is en route or when the patient is picked up.<br>
        <b>APIs for Traffic Control & Routing:</b><br>

        <u>Google Maps API </u>- For ambulance routing and hospital location services.<br>
        <u>Traffic Signal Control (IoT API)</u> - Collaborate with city traffic management and create an API to control traffic lights based on the ambulance's location.</p>
        <h3>3. Database</h3>
        <p><b>Real-Time Database:</b><br>

        <u>Firebase Firestore</u> - Great for real-time sync of SOS alerts, ambulance status, etc.<br>
        <u>MongoDB</u> - NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of unstructured data.<br>
        <b>Relational Database (Optional):</b><br>

        <u>PostgreSQL</u> - If you need structured data and relationships (e.g., user roles, location tracking, SOS logs).<br>
        <b>Data to Store:</b><br>

        User profiles (police, ambulance drivers, general public).
        SOS alerts and status.
        Geolocation data for routing and nearby users.</p>
        <h3>4. Authentication & Security</h3>
        <p><b>User Authentication:</b><br>

        <u>Firebase Authentication</u> - Secure login system with support for email, Google, Facebook, etc.<br>
        <u>OAuth 2.0</u> - Secure authentication flow for users and emergency responders.<br>
        <b>Data Encryption:</b><br>

        Use SSL (HTTPS) to encrypt data in transit.
        Encrypt sensitive data in the database (e.g., user information, location data).</p><br>
        <h3>5. Push Notifications</h3>
        <p><b>Service:</b> Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications to both Android and iOS.<br>
        <b>General Users:</b> Receive alerts for nearby accidents.<br>
        <b>Responders (police, ambulance):</b> Get real-time alerts with geolocation details.</p><br>
        <h3>6. Maps & Geolocation</h3>
        <p><b>Service: Google Maps API for:</b><br>
        Showing nearby accidents.
        Routing ambulance drivers to accident locations and hospitals.
        Geolocation API to identify nearby users within a specific radius for sending out SOS alerts.</p><br>
        <h3>7. Traffic Signal Integration (IoT)</h3>
        <p><b>IoT Frameworks: To control traffic lights, you'll need:</b><br>

        IoT APIs provided by the local traffic management system or IoT providers (this may require collaboration with government authorities).
        A custom API that allows your backend to send requests to change traffic lights along the ambulance's route.<br>
        <b>Data Transmission</b>: Use MQTT Protocol or RESTful APIs to communicate with IoT devices.</p><br>

        <h3>8. Hosting & Cloud Services</h3>
        <p><b>Cloud Hosting:</b><br>
        Google Cloud or AWS to host your backend.
        Use Firebase for real-time services and notifications.<br>
        <b>Serverless Computing (Optional):</b><br>
        AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for event-based triggers like when an SOS is raised or when an ambulance accepts the task.</p>
        <h3>9. Analytics & Monitoring</h3>
        <p><b>Service:</b><br>
        Firebase Analytics or Google Analytics to track app usage, SOS alerts, and responder activity.
        Monitor how many users are using the app and how quickly responders react.</p>
        <h3>10. Testing & Deployment</h3>
        <p><b>Mobile App Testing:</b><br>

        <u>Firebase Test Lab</u> - Test your app on different Android and iOS devices.
        TestFlight for iOS app testing before public release.<br>
        <b>App Store Deployment:</b><br>
        Deploy your app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store using the respective platform's developer tools.</p><br>
