            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I have a project idea based on SOS alert like, if an accident happens in an area the nearby people will open the application and give an SOS alert it will raise complaint to the nearby police station and the nearby ambulance drivers and then the ambulance driver can pick the patient by clicking the pick up button and once they picked up the patient they will choose the hospital it reroute you to the selected hospital and the signals in those areas will be changed to green to make it traffic free.<br>And also this app is used to alert nearby people around the area by clicking the SOS button an alert or message will be pushed to the nearby people.</p>
            <a href="steps.html"><h2>Steps Involved</h2></a>
            <p>After describing my project I have planned some of the procedures to be followed so that the process of this project will be an easiest one and it will not be an complex one. I have maken every step by step process like from the first what is need to be displayed and what are all the process need to be done and atlast in which software we can implement ans the API connectivity. So the process will be an easiest one.</p>
