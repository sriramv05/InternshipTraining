    <h1>Steps Involved</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>1. User App Development</h3>
        <p><b>Develop a mobile app using a cross-platform framework like Flutter or React Native so it works on both Android and iOS.
        Two main users:</b><br>
        General users (public) - They can send out an SOS alert if they witness an accident.
        Responders (ambulance drivers, police) - They receive the alert and respond to the emergency.</p>
        <h3>2. SOS Alert System</h3>
        <p><b>When an accident happens:</b><br>
        A nearby user clicks the SOS button in the app.
        The app captures the user's location and sends a signal to nearby police, ambulance drivers, and other users within a specified range (like 5 km).
        Push notifications are sent to responders and people around the area using a service like Firebase Cloud Messaging.</p>
        <h3>3. Ambulance Dispatch & Routing</h3>
        <p><b>Ambulance drivers receive alerts:</b><br>
        When a driver accepts the alert by clicking the Pick-up button, the app will provide them with directions to the accident site using Google Maps API.
        After picking up the patient, the driver can select a nearby hospital (listed by the app) and the app will then reroute them to the hospital.</p>
        <h3>4. Traffic Signal Integration</h3>
        <p><b>Traffic signal control:</b><br>
        The app communicates with IoT-controlled traffic lights in the city.
        As the ambulance moves toward the hospital, traffic signals on its route will automatically turn green to clear the way.
        This requires coordination with local government authorities to integrate with their traffic systems.</p>
        <h3>5. Real-Time Communication</h3>
        <p><b>Keep everyone updated:</b><br>
        Use real-time communication (via WebSockets or Firebase) so police, hospitals, and other users can track the status of the SOS alert and ambulance (e.g., "En Route," "Picked Up," "At Hospital").</p>
        <h3>6. Push Notifications</h3>
        <p><b>When an SOS is raised:</b><br>
        Nearby users and responders are notified through push notifications (using Firebase Cloud Messaging).
        Notifications will be customized to show different messages to different types of users (e.g., public users get a general alert, while ambulance drivers get the location details).</p>
        <h3>7. Database Setup</h3>
        <p><b>Save and manage data:</b><br>
        User data (profiles for police, drivers, general users).
        SOS alerts (location, time, status).
        Routing data (to track routes taken by ambulances).
        Use databases like Firebase (for real-time data) or PostgreSQL for more structured data.</p>
        <h3>8. Security & Authentication</h3>
        <p><b>User Authentication:</b><br>
        Users log in using Firebase Authentication to ensure only authorized personnel can take certain actions (like police or ambulance drivers).
        Protect sensitive data (like locations) by encrypting data both at rest and during transmission.</p>
        <h3>9. Monitoring & Analytics</h3>
        <p><b>Track performance:</b><br>
        Use Google Analytics to monitor app usage, SOS alerts, and how often the system is used.
        Create a real-time dashboard to track ongoing SOS alerts, ambulance status, and traffic signal controls.</p>
        <h3>10. Testing & Deployment</h3>
        <p>Test the app across different devices using tools like Firebase Test Lab.
        Deploy the app on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for users to download and start using it.</p>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(33, 153, 174); padding-top: 10px;">Steps for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</h4>
        <p>Build basic SOS alert functionality where users can send an alert, and responders (police and ambulances) get notified.
        Add ambulance routing with navigation to the accident and hospital.
        Later, integrate traffic signals for green-light routes and add advanced features (like public alerts).</p>
